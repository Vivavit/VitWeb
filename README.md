# Vit Website

I created this for myself as a portfolio website. It showcases everything I've learned so far. Right now, it's built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but soon I'll add Laravel to make it a full-fledged website hehe ><

## Features
- Elements follow the mouse cursor
- ...and honestly, not much else for now, bruhh 😅

## Installation

I haven't set it up with Git yet, lol, so stay tuned for updates!
